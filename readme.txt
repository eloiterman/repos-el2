This is a basic bootstrap site. I chose to create my site this way as a quick and dirty way to get a fast, responsive site up and running and to demo some basic bootstap chops for those interested if I know bootstrap or not. An alternate unfinished hand coded version is up and zipped for archival purposes. It had much of the same ideas.In the Images folder there is a ‘WIP’ or Work In Progress Folder, where I have a backup of mockups and art in AI (Illustrator).The site is straightforward for now the idea is to brand myself for now and for the future:present goal –GET IT UP GET IT DONE- PHASE I: -COMPLETE-Requirements: -layout concept –one page scrolling UI dev who I am and what I do page.-page must be responsive and touch device friendly (No UI dev worth their salt doesn’t have this)-Nice to have: parallax –changing Background it adds some ‘flare’ to the site but should not be distracting.-Three sections –1-‘landing section –phase1In Phase 2-this will also be a place to highlight new achievements and completed projects to showcase2- Skills section –phase one –a skillset summary and fast elevator speech3- Background –A bio section –for those that would read a little more to see hat makes me ticksections 2/3 are also good to have content-wise for SEO reasons and the BIO comes up nicely when I link it in a LinkedIn post.PHASE II:1-add a ‘highlighted projects section’ to the landing section2-Add a new ‘services’ section –with descriptions and icons3- Add a slideshow of recent and completed graphic and web projects4-nice to have- add an ‘easter egg’ to display my old flash game –if the user is using a desktop device.
